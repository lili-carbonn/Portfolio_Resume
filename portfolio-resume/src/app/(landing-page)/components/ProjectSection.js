      "fullDescription": "This project contains two C programs that demonstrate advanced multithreaded programming concepts. The first program (shoeElection.c) simulates different types of shoes taking turns on a stage in a round-robin fashion, using mutexes and condition variables for synchronization. The second program (FedOops.c) simulates a package processing system with colored teams of workers processing packages through various stations, using semaphores to prevent deadlocks by implementing an all-or-nothing resource acquisition strategy.",

Collaborated with students from biology, psychology, and engineering, as well as faculty from sociology, chemistry, and management. Conducted interviews and performed data analysis to identify patterns and gaps in support services. Provided recommendations for improving mental health resources in emergency service organizations.",
