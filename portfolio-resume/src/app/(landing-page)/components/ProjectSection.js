    "fullDescription": "This project implements a graph-based machine learning approach to identify influential users on Yelp. Users and businesses are represented as nodes, with reviews forming edges in a heterogeneous graph. The model leverages Sentence-BERT embeddings for text analysis, network centrality metrics, and sentiment features. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) serves as a baseline, while an enhanced Graph Attention Network (GAT) improves accuracy by incorporating multi-head attention. The study demonstrates that integrating multiple feature types significantly enhances prediction accuracy, reaching 81% in classifying influential users.",

The first program (shoeElection.c) simulates different types of shoes taking turns on a stage in a round-robin fashion, using mutexes and condition variables for synchronization. The second program (FedOops.c) simulates a package processing system with colored teams of workers processing packages through various stations, using semaphores to prevent deadlocks by implementing an all-or-nothing resource acquisition strategy.",
